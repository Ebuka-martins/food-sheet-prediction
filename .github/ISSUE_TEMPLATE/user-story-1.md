As a Predictive data analyst
I want to compare food production patterns across European regions
So that I can identify significant regional differences and their correlation with economic and climate factors

Acceptance Criteria
- AC1: Given I am on the Data Analysis page
- AC2: When I select multiple countries or regions
- AC3: Then the system displays time series and comparison plots for selected metrics (e.g., Production, Value)
- AC4: And provides statistical insights (e.g., coefficient of variation, ANOVA results)
- AC5: And highlights correlations with GDP per capita (r > 0.75 for relevant metrics)

Technical Notes
- AC1: Uses `plot_time_series` and `plot_comparisons` from `visualizations.py`
- AC2: Integrates with `prepare_country_comparison_data` from `data_analysis.py`
- AC3: Implements statistical calculations (e.g., ANOVA, correlation) in `data_analysis.py`
- AC4: Updates `get_key_insights` to include correlation and variation metrics
