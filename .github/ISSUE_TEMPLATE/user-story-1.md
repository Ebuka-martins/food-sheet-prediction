about: Analyze Regional Food Production Differences
title: '' user story
labels: ''
assignees: '' 

---

As a Predictive data analyst
I want to compare food production patterns across European regions
So that I can identify significant regional differences and their correlation with economic and climate factors

Acceptance Criteria
- AC1: Given I am on the Data Analysis page
- AC2: When I select multiple countries or regions
- AC3: Then the system displays time series and comparison plots for selected metrics (e.g., Production, Value)
- AC4: And provides statistical insights (e.g., coefficient of variation, ANOVA results)
- AC5: And highlights correlations with GDP per capita (r > 0.75 for relevant metrics)

Technical Notes
- AC1: Uses `plot_time_series` and `plot_comparisons` from `visualizations.py`
- AC2: Integrates with `prepare_country_comparison_data` from `data_analysis.py`
- AC3: Implements statistical calculations (e.g., ANOVA, correlation) in `data_analysis.py`

title: ''food-sheet-prediction
labels: ''
assignees: Ebuka-martins

---

As a researcher
I want to generate forecasts for food production metrics
So that I can predict future agricultural output for specific countries and items

Acceptance Criteria

AC1: Given I am on the Forecasting page
AC2: When I select a country, item, and metric with at least three years of data
AC3: Then the system generates a forecast using time series models
AC4: And displays a plot with historical and forecasted values
AC5: And achieves R² scores between 0.78 and 0.92 for the forecast
Technical Notes

AC1: Uses generate_forecast from forecasting.py with Holt-Winters or linear regression
AC2: Integrates with plot_forecast from visualizations.py
AC3: Ensures data validation for at least three data points in forecasting.py

about:  Predict Agricultural Output with Machine
title: ''food-sheet-prediction
labels: ''
assignees: Ebuka-martins

---

As a data scientist
I want to train a machine learning model to predict agricultural output
So that I can identify key drivers and achieve high prediction accuracy

Acceptance Criteria

AC1: Given I am on the Machine Learning page
AC2: When I select features (e.g., previous year output, climate indicators) and a target (e.g., Value)
AC3: Then the system trains a model (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost)
AC4: And displays performance metrics (R², MAE, RMSE)
AC5: And achieves RMSE 15-20% lower than statistical methods
AC6: And allows me to make predictions with custom inputs
Technical Notes

AC1: Uses train_model and predict from ml_models.py
AC2: Integrates with Streamlit session state for model persistence
AC3: Implements feature importance analysis in ml_models.py
AC4: Updates app.py to display feature importance and cross-validation results

about:  Identify Food Security Vulnerabilities
title: ''food-sheet-prediction
labels: ''
assignees: Ebuka-martins

---

As a policymaker
I want to analyze food security metrics across European countries
So that I can identify vulnerabilities and prioritize policy interventions

Acceptance Criteria

AC1: Given I am on the Data Analysis or Recommendations page
AC2: When I select countries and metrics (e.g., Import Quantity, Food Supply)
AC3: Then the system displays import dependency ratios and supply variability
AC4: And highlights countries with import dependency > 50% for key food categories
AC5: And shows a negative correlation (r = -0.68) between agricultural diversity and supply volatility
Technical Notes

AC1: Uses get_key_insights from data_analysis.py to compute dependency and variability metrics
AC2: Integrates with plot_comparisons for visualization
AC3: Implements correlation analysis in data_analysis.py
AC4: Updates app.py to display vulnerability insights on the Recommendations page

AC4: Updates data_loader.py to preprocess data for forecasting

about:  View Data Visualizations with Custom Colors
title: ''food-sheet-prediction
labels: ''
assignees: Ebuka-martins

---

As a Predictive data analyst
I want to view distribution plots of numeric data with distinct colors
So that I can easily differentiate between various metrics in the dataset

Acceptance Criteria

AC1: Given I am on the Data Overview page
AC2: When I view the Data Distributions section
AC3: Then the system displays histograms for up to six numeric columns
AC4: And each histogram uses a different color from a Plotly palette
AC5: And includes a legend identifying each column
Technical Notes

AC1: Uses plot_distributions from visualizations.py
AC2: Integrates with Plotly’s make_subplots for faceted histograms
AC3: Implements color assignment using px.colors.qualitative.Plotly
AC4: Updates app.py to call plot_distributions with palette parameter
